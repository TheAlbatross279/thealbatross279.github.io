In the six months since I've written a post, I've been dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. I don't write this to elicit sympathy but to bring a stigmatized topic into the light and talk about what has helped me return to the joy of creating.

In depression, it seems the only movement is in routine; it provides us the freedom of not spending energy deciding if we want to do something.​ We can't think of bettering ourselves or improving our circumstances because, it feels like too much. We are too burdened to have energy and worse yet, we don't believe that things will actually get better. This was true for me; I had stopped writing, and only kept reading because I had made a good habit of it. Everything else that wasn't a daily routine fell away. 

To conquer depression, I had to first believe that I could get better. At the same time, I needed healing and time to process my feelings. Over the six months, I worked to regain myself and return to the hobbies I loved. Here are the 3 tips I have for moving toward health and away from depression.

**Act Small**.

Motivation is not found but created through small actions. With that said, the most difficult challenge with depression is doing something new. Tasks that might feel surmountable when you're confident now feel daunting. But the secret to motivation is doing something, anything to get started.

When I was first told this, I thought that it wouldn't work for me. I had always waited for motivation to come to me rather than acting. I also had trouble breaking tasks down into achievable pieces so I would give up before the task had started. In reality, the pieces I thought were achieveable were still too large and needed to be broken down further.

If your dishes are piling up, don't think you have to do everything; just wash one dish. As Tim Ferriss said, do much less than you are capable of doing and the sense of accomplishment will make it easier to do the rest. Give yourself slack and recognize that it will get done. When it doesn't get done, forgive yourself and do something smaller.

Over time, these small tasks will get done no matter what state you are in emotionally. Routine will ensure you don't fall apart. The feeling of accomplishment will drive you to do more, even when you don't really feel like it. You will get better at it.

**Perceive Again**.

Those who are the most successful are often those who feel like they're doing the worst. This effect, which is one half of the Dunning-Kruger effect, suggests not only that our self-perception can be skewed, but that it is a natural human tendency to have an inaccurate view of our situation.

There are certainly always reasons we are depressed and most of them are very real and understandable. However, sometimes our perception of our circumstances and situations is biased.

The trick is in learning to understand what is real and what is biased or inaccurate. Why do we feel bad when a coworker congratulates us on work well done? Why do we feel that others are angry at us when they don't say good morning? Why are we biased toward negativity? Each of us has individual patterns of thought and understanding the root of them helps clear the fog of misperception. Listen to yourself and note the thoughts you have. Pay attention and start to challenge them.

The best way to change your perspective is to talk to someone else about what's happening to you. It doesn't have to be a therapist, it could be a friend or loved one, but an outsider can be the best person to give you perspective. Preferably, talk to someone who has your best interest in mind and has the professional skills to help you understand yourself. 

**Reach Out**.

Fifteen years ago, I had bone surgery on right elbow to remove benign cysts. When I first went to the children's hospital, I thought that I didn't belong, and that I wasn't *that* sick. But the truth was, I needed care as much as the other children did even if my problems weren't as severe.

Our pain can feel like it's not as bad as others, and our lives can seem not as difficult, but any pain is worth treating. You have a right to feel better and you can help yourself by reaching out for help. If nothing else seems possible, ask someone to share the burden.

I began this blog a year ago, and I intend to fight depression by posting to this blog and making creativity routine. To give and help others brings me the most joy and is a small action toward creating motivation when I am not feeling well. Most of all, I hope that sharing this will remind others that they are definitely not alone.

Please share what helps you in the comments below and let others know they aren’t alone.
