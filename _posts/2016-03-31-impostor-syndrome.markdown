When I was in elementary school, I had an identity crisis. I sat down with my stepmom and told her I didn't know who I was and what I liked. It boiled down to this: I didn't know whether I was a Scooby-Doo-person or Pokemon-person. To me, the question was fundamental -- I needed a brand, something that identified me to people of like-mind, that you could look at me and go "That's Kim, she likes Scooby-Doo," and that would be a sufficient summarization of my life.

In the years following that conversation, I went through several "identities" that were dependent on things I could categorize and summarize to solidify my self perception. For several years, I was an obsessive Beatles fan, alienating my friends and family with my singular musical focus. In high school, I realized that being so obsessed wasn't fun, but I still sought to find something that defined me. For a while, it was writing. But even though I wanted to identify as a writer-person, I never felt like a *writer*. Even though I had written a 200 page story, dozens of poems, and I was several chapters into my first novel. Even though I worked as a professional writer for some time, I still feel like a fraud as twenty-something me asks, am I a programmer-person or a writer-person?

> Joshua Fields Millburn wanted to start with the premise that we are all writers so we can do away with uncertainty and start writing. 

Joshua Fields Millburn mentioned in one of his [writing seminars](http://www.theminimalists.com/class/) that we are all writers. We are writers because we write every day and communicate every day through text. Okay, you might think, but we aren't all *writers*. We don't all spend hours a day in front of a keyboard crafting delicately planned sentences and plot devices. But what Joshua Fields Millburn was trying to fight is the inherent questions people ask when confronting their desires for identity and their perceptions of themselves: am I a writer? Can I call myself that? Is that how people see me, or am I just an impostor? Joshua Fields Millburn wanted to start with the premise that we are all writers so we can do away with uncertainty and start writing. And sure, that works, *sometimes*.

### The Impostor in the Room
The feeling that you don't belong, are a fraud, or that at any moment, someone will discover that it was a colossal mistake to allow you to *belong* is often called Impostor Syndrome. Impostor Syndrome was first documented by psychologists Dr. Pauline Rose Clance and Dr. Suzanne Imes when [studying successful women](http://www.paulineroseclance.com/pdf/ip_high_achieving_women.pdf) in academia, although the syndrome is much more wide-spread in society. In the tech world, Impostor Syndrome is rampant. Exceptional programmers, including titans like Jeff Dean (who is responsible for much of the theory behind Google's infrastructure and piloted the development of programming paradigms that are used all over the world) admitted to feeling like an impostor. Leaving the rest of us "average" programmers wondering, If Jeff Dean feels like an impostor, then what the hell are we?

Here's the rub -- those who experience impostor syndrome tend to underestimate their competence and attribute any success to luck. No amount of reinforcement can resolve the feeling, because the person devalues the reinforcement and and questions its validity. So no matter how much you succeed, you feel like a fraud. This feeling can eventually undermine your productivity and cause worse performance. Every time you say, "this is garbage work," or "I'm just stupid," you reinforce these feelings and increase your anxiety. 

If you feel this way, it's important to start recognizing how you are reinforcing this feeling. Dr. Rose and Dr. Imes, cite three main reinforcements they found in their study:

### If I work harder, I can cover up how bad I am
We tend to think we can fool people by working more and looking busy; I am so guilty of comparing myself against [Real Programmers](http://www.businessinsider.com/syndromes-drive-coders-crazy-2014-3). They code for fun and are super fast at coding. They don't push bugs to production or spend all day wondering why a piece of code isn't executing only to find you commented it out and it couldn't have run. You feel you have to work twice as hard and three times as long to do work even moderately as good as your peers. Then once you achieve success, you attribute it to your extra effort and not to you abilities. Because that perception of inadequacy hasn't changed, you success feels short-lived, even when you received positive feedback.

You can counter this by collecting and remembering positive feedback when you receive it and *believing it*. Do the mental exercise of taking your peers at their word and some of it might stick.

### I feel fake because I am being fake
This is a fascinating case where we reserve our true selves, putting on a persona because we fear inadequacy. Since we are dissembling ourselves, we know that we are phony and so we affirm that we are phonies. For example, if you use charm or humor to flatter someone, you think may not have a high opinion of you, any positive feedback they give you is attributed to your falseness, making you feel that you are false and the praise is false. 


Drs. Rose and Imes recommend that you rollplay and image what someone would actually say if you told them your success was because of your flattery instead of your hard work. Would you teacher say they gave you an A because you brought in cookies? Unlikely. By countering these thoughts, you gain the ability to rationalize irrational thoughts and base your feelings on evidence rather than conjecture and anxiety. You should also risk being yourself, since the negative consequences you fear rarely, if ever, come to fruition.
 
### Successful people aren't liked
It can be daunting to be successful, powerful, and confident. This is especially true of women who are mocked and perceived as hostile the more successful they are, but in general, no one wants to be perceived as being too dominant or unlikeable because they exude confidence. To someone who is already insecure, this fear can constantly reinforce Impostor Syndrome. 

To combat this fear, it's good to practice being confident and powerful. Drs. Rose and Imes did this in their study through role-play, where women acted out being powerful and confident by saying things like "I am bright." The act of doing this made women confront their fear and deal with it. In some cases, women were able to reaffirm their self-worth and achieve a solid balance by flattering themselves. They learned to acknowledge themselves and their fears about acknowledging their competency subside. This is the tried and true 'fake it til you make it' approach and it works.

### Commit to Changing your perception
The most important thing is that if you feel you don't belong, or aren't what you say you are or want to be, then you have to commit to change. In the moments of insecurity and anxiety, this is possibly the hardest thing to do. I suffered in grad school when I went back to do a Computer Science Master's after graduating with an English degree and working as a writer. The smartest and most successful people in the program were my close friends, and I often felt like I was there I was barely squeaking by when they were succeeding. I had many emotional breakdowns as a result, and in the height of one, I begged my husband to "just tell me I'm not stupid." His response was striking: he told me, "I'm not here all the time, so when you feel this way, you have to be the one who tells you that you aren't stupid." I knew he was right so I got up and walked into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and said, "you're not stupid." 

> Our perceptions of what makes a writer-person or a programmer-person are fundamentally subjective and based on our over-estimations of what others are doing and under-estimations of what we're capable of.

His advice was invaluable to me and helped me realize that even in moments of complete weakness, I had to *decide* to be the one to give myself a hand up. Since then, I stopped worrying so much about whether I was a computer scientist or even a writer and started focusing on what I was good at and not worrying about the identity of holding either of those titles. Our perceptions of what makes a writer-person or a programmer-person are fundamentally subjective and based on our over-estimations of what others are doing and under-estimations of what we're capable of. What's more, our identities are not based on categories and you don't have to be summarized by an interest or profession, which means you don't have to feel like you don't live up to the label. As someone who has always had a dual identity, I've come to accept my humanities and engineering background and worry less about how either makes me inadequate. So when I ask, am I writer-person or a programmer-person, I answer myself, "both."
