There's no preaching here, just life and observations.

I've contemplated starting this blog for a long time, but never felt I had a topic or niche to fill. After years of waiting, I think it's finally time to talk about the topic of bettering and de-stressing my life and how I'm doing it.

If you check out the [about](/about) section of this blog, you'll find out more about how I got here. The TL;DR of it is that I have had a year of major change: illness, new puppy, wedding, and stress from work and life.

I had a bit of inspiration about tidying my living space after arguing with my husband Chris about it this summer. He is and always has been exceptionally neat and I, exceptionally lazy. And after spending a week with a perfectly clean apartment, I realized that a cleaner, neater space reduced my stress.

As part of my recurring issue with iritis, or inflammation in the iris of my eye, I've been advised to de-stress my life, which is great advice in theory but generally difficult. Stress comes in so many forms, much of it unexpected and unpreventable as life happens. So I looked around myself and thought, "What can I control?" -- a good place to start was my living space.

Chris and I have been living apart on and off for the better part of 4 years as each of has done our Master's degree while the other worked. During the summer months, we are together up in the Bay Area for a short time before returning to school. That means we each have our own apartment during the year and spend the weekends together whenever possible.

Here is our apartment that I live in now just after we moved in:

It looks fairly minimalistic, and it was at the time before everything was unpacked. Much later, it got cluttered and I felt increasingly bad about my space. It turns out that I'm very sensitive to clutter and messiness, despite being so messy growing up. I decided it was time for a change, much to Chris' delight.

Over the summer, I heard about the book [*The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering/dp/1607747308) by Marie Kondo. On our honeymoon this year, I read the whole book and was inspired. I immediately began cleaning up and getting rid of stuff and keeping only what I loved.

Here's some before and after of what I did:

I tackled a lot in a short period of time, and in the process, I began to explore minimalism and eventually Zero Waste. I plan on posting more on this later, but this is where I'm at now.

Overall, I think I've reduced my stress quite a bit, although my health is about the same, I feel a lot happier.

As I progress, I'll post more about the struggles and things I've found.
