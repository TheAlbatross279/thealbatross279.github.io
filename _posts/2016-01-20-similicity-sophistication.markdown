I've found that there is a tension between wanting stuff and wanting to be free of stuff. At least for me, this has been true when trying to embrace minimalism. On one of [The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com) Google Hangouts Q&A sessions, I posed a question about dealing with my seemingly incongru values of wanting to craft my space in a beautiful way by refining the style and bringing in items that reflect what I love, and realizing that you can't buy your way to happiness. Specifically, I asked them about what to do with my rug that I feel 'didn't tie the room together'. I wondered, is spending time, money, and energy to add (or replace) stuff ever the answer?

When thinking about this, I realize that fundamentally, I *want* to acquire. I want a prettier rug, a sleeker couch, more fashionable wardrobe, etc because I want to craft a *style*. Why though? Introspection revealed that what I have a fundamental desire to  have a beautiful space and the items in the space I have now are not beautiful or not as beautiful as they could be, which is driving me to want more. At first, this felt very against minimalism, which I also value.

However, I realized through the process of decluttering that having nice, well chosen stuff around me improves the way I feel about the space and ultimately, how I feel overall. See that chair? I love that chair and having around makes me feel at home and feel good. In that way, it adds value to my life. But shouldn't value not come from stuff?

Meanwhile, I'm considering the values of minimalism -- saving your time and energy for things that matter and not spending it worrying about stuff. It seems like all I was doing was worrying about stuff. 

I thought, maybe I'll just hold onto this stuff, and update the look someday. But this idea made me crazy; I was reeling against the idea of *someday*; holding off on living the way you want to live and doing the things you want now in the present. Why wait til I have my own home to have the style I want? It doesn't make sense to postpone when you can remove stuff you don't like and make the space better with small changes because you have to live there *now* and you should feel good about your space. But did that mean I had to go out and buy the stuff I wanted to refill my space? I needed some information to help me sort out my conundrum.

So what did the Minimalists Ryan and Josh have to say? If you listen to their podcasts or read their blog (and I recommend you do), you know that they will often say minimalism is not about how much stuff you have but is more about only keeping what adds value to your life and not indulging in consumerism. They offered this advice: if the rug annoys you and you can do without it, then just get rid of the rug. Then if you need a rug, don't bankrupt yourself or unwisely splurge on replacing it. In essence, what they were saying is that stuff can add value to your life, and that value can take many forms -- it can be a functional value an aesthetic value or even maybe a sentimental value -- although they warn against letting any of these values overrun your life.

So how do you avoid consumption but still curate your space? Time and intention. Intention involves selecting only what you love or what brings value. It also means waiting for the right item to come your way. Time means that you aren't psychologically burdened waiting for the right item. If you are so desperate to change something, it probably means you have something that isn't adding value and you should declutter and get rid of before you buy anything. You'll probably feel better after getting rid of it.

Another interesting perspective I've found comes from [Baiyina Hughley](http://www.baiyina.com), a minimalist and an interior designer. I love her style of minimalism because she focuses on beauty through minimalism as one of her values. She has lots of great advice for those wanting to develop a style and teaches you ways to make good choices about your stuff. On the subject of luxury items, she says, 

> "Minimalism is the perfect opportunity to bring luxury into your life -- getting rid of things that aren't that great, that you don't really love, that you don't really need, that you don't really use and getting that one thing that is amazing, is the best quality that you can afford." 

Again, the value here is in being intentional with what you buy -- buying quality items and investing in one good item over many so-so items. Minimalism isn't about spending a minimal amount of money (within reason of course), it's about making smart choices with your money. This means not over-buying and not buying just because, since ultimately, it's those "just because" items that make you the most unsatisfied. 

The takeaway for me is this: if you value having nice stuff or having a nice space, it's okay to replace what you have or bring new items into your home. But overall, don't bring in too much and do it all with intention, and above everything, keep it simple. For as Baiyina says: 

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. "
