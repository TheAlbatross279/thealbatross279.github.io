Unhappiness creeps in slowly and without grandeur. Almost always it's there long before you notice it, despite noticeable signals. The trick is identifying these clues early and dealing with your feelings before they become overwhelming. As you analyze your unhappiness, you can find your signals and learn to make changes. Something must change; is it your situation or your attitude? Here are a few signs that signal it's time to make a change and how to enact it.

**You feel stuck or you aren't growing**

One of the surest signs of needing a change is stagnation. We get into ruts or feel that our motivation dips as we do the same thing over and over again. Change is hard and scary, but when you find that you're teaching more than learning, explaining more than listening, maybe it's time for a new challenge. 

Part of being satisfied in your work and in your hobbies is whether you feel like you're progressing. If you aren't making progress or are getting slowed by lack of motivation, maybe there's something that's getting you into a rut.

Look for small changes, taking on a new responsibility, giving up one that doesn't challenge you, or consider making a big change if there aren't any obvious opportunities around you. 

**You're indulging more**

For me, consumption and indulgence are the habits I find most indicative of unhappiness. This can be shopping, binge watching shows, and fantasizing about things like improving my appearance, my home, or my lifestyle. When I'm happy and challenged,  I consume these a little, but I don't distract myself with them.

If you are lucky enough to identify your pacifiers, then you can start to make positive changes. Sometimes limiting access to pacifiers can help -- uninstall Pinterest for a month, [cancel your Netflix subscription](http://dontshootthealbatross.com/minimalism/hobbies/lifestlye/netflix-sabbatical) or make a rule about not using your phone in the presence of others. Sabbaticals can work and can teach you moderation as you learn to live without, but they may not work for everyone and they may not work forever.

True pacifiers are habits and can be psychologically entrenched. Being analytical about *why* you are bored or *why* you are trying to pacify yourself can lead to real change long-term. If your time is filled with only pacifiers, then something needs to change.

**Your expectations aren't met**

What do you expect out of your work, your freetime, your relationships? You can first ask what your expectations are and then figure out if they are reasonable. Do you expect to be the best employee, the best writer, the best XYZ? If you aren't, then you might feel unhappy because your expectations aren't met. It's even worse when they *can't* be met.

There is always someone better than you and worse than you, so if your expectation is to be the best then you can never be satisfied. If this is the case, then it's your attitude that needs to change.  As non-judgmentally as possible, identify why your expect what you expect. Understanding why might be all it takes to change your attitude. 

Our expectations can be reasonable, however; we can expect to have our partner listen to our worries; we can expect to be respected at work; we can expect some amount of growth. If these expectations aren't met, then something is not right. Address it head on with yourself or others, and decide how things should change.

**What does it mean to make a change**

The change you think you should make isn't always the change you *should* make. The change to move into a bigger space because your house feels crapmped might not be a great decision if you are taking on more debt or more responsibility to clean and maintain that space. Maybe having less stuff is actually the change you should be making.

Maybe the frustration of a relationship is actually an opportunity to grow together instead of apart. It is rarely perfectly clear what needs to change, which is why the first step is always evaluating where the unhappiness is, then considering the impact of change.
