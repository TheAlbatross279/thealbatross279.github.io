There are plenty of platitudes about human imperfection -- "nobody's perfect," and "we all make mistakes" -- and it would be nice if we could actually believe them. It's one of the things that everyone universally agrees is true, but when it comes to truly accepting that everyone is flawed, that we individually are flawed, the thought doesn't breach the thick wall of our egos' self-defense. The truth is that being flawed just isn't okay.

It's not about the perfect images we see every day or the rose-colored glasses that lens our view of celebrities, or those who seemingly "have it all" and are without flaws. It's not even about our friends who are better than us, our coworkers who are smarter than us or that woman on the street whose hair is perfectly styled in fashion. It's accepting that we can't achieve what others can, that you should be striving for betterment, for self-control, for perfection.

> The lie is that someday, there will be something we buy, something we wear, something we do to ourselves to craft ourselves into the perfect, cool, accepted person we are striving to be.

 We think, "if I don't wear fashionable clothes, I won't be liked, people with think I'm uncool, I won't get ahead at work. If I don't strive for perfection, I'm giving up. If I give up, then I'm a social outcast; I'm 'frumpy;' I'm unlovable." The lie is that someday, there will be something we buy, something we wear, something we do to ourselves to craft ourselves into the perfect, cool, accepted person we are striving to be. 

When we strive for perfection through these material things, we are often reminded how much of a lie it is; after a month, the new shirt you bought doesn't make you feel as happy, the new car feels boring, the new haircut feels shaggy. It's the cycle of discontent. And we often turn that discontent toward our self-esteem. In the blink of an eye, you are defined by the qualities you lack, rather than the qualities that make you valuable, and no amount of stuff can fix it.

**Striving into Perpetuity**

There are two messages that get confounded: one is that we should be striving; the second is that perfection is an achievable state. Perfection is easy to define in theory using the standards we set for ourselves, but it's impossible to define concretely for an individual, and even less possible to achieve. 

For example, if you worry about your health and meet someone who works out 5 times per week, it's easy to say "well I *should* be working out like them" and therefore, "I'm not doing enough" or "I'm not perfect because I choose not to put in the effort." But there's a trap there -- sure, working out is a healthy goal, but there is no metric for exactly how much you should be working out. There's no concrete endpoint, there's no perfect ratio of cardio to weight-training that will allow you to arrive at the state of **perfect**. The right amount of fitness is where you feel healthy, not based on how much time you spend working out. In other words, if you strive for perfection you'll find there's nothing to strive for -- the target just doesn't exist. 

It's easy to write off your anxious feelings, to blame the media or circumstances for your imperfection, or blame yourself, thinking that you're not "good" enough. It's much harder and more useful to consider why it's not okay for you to be imperfect. Often we have deep-seeded reasons for feeling like we aren't good enough, and the first step toward conquering your self-esteem is to start with introspection.

##**Breaking Perfectionism through Introspection**

When thinking about my own perfectionism, I did some soul searching. I knew that my perfectionism was motivated by something -- and I also knew that it was limiting me. I spent so much time worrying about what others thought of me, how I was performing, if I was performing up to par with the talented people around me, I stunted my own growth and crippled my confidence. I needed to dig out the root of it and discover what it was that prevented me from being the confident person I wanted to be. It came down to a few things:

**Fear of Rejection**

Events of my childhood lead me to have extreme anxiety about being rejected by those I cared about. I blamed myself when others didn't show me affection, when friends moved on to spend time with others, when someone said something less than kind to me. I thought, if they liked me or if I was more likable, maybe they would have been nicer to me. 

This thought pattern meant I blamed myself for being imperfect, but it also drove me to seek out perfection so I would be liked. If I was cool, if I was nice, pretty, funny, etc, I would be accepted.

In the undertow of this feeling came the desire to achieve, to be successful, to be respected. And if I couldn't achieve, I couldn't be what I thought I wanted to be, then I would give up. I would doubt myself and limit myself, which was the source of a lot of my [imposter syndrome](http://dontshootthealbatross.com/writing/impostor-syndrome).

**Hyper-responsibility**

Because I felt responsible for other's opinions of me, I became hyper-responsible for my relationships. If my friends were feeling unhappy, I had to fix them. I had to fix myself if needed so they would like me, and I would maintain the attachment.

This lead me to feel responsible for things I couldn't change or control. I was responsible for fixing my relationships, fixing people, fixing myself, and striving to make perfection out of imperfection. In my mind, perfection meant that I was secure.

Although I certainly haven't broken the patterns entirely, my self-awareness lead me to relinquish the idea that I should be perfect -- at least a little. I realized that chasing perfection was harmful, and learning to let go of guilt has helped me give myself a little credit. The truth is I've always been imperfect and people still love me. My friends accept that I have flaws, and they still hang out with me. And that's worth remembering.

##**Start Fighting Your Perfectionism**

If you struggle with perfectionism, here are some steps you can take that helped me deal with my own:

###1) **Recognize the comparisons you make**

Theodore Roosevelt (and also my step-mom) said that "comparison is the thief of joy" and of course, we know we make ourselves miserable, yet we still compare ourselves to everyone around us and we think we deserve the criticism. 

> There's no objective measure that is truly sufficient to account for the variability in life. 

My stepmom also always reminded us that there will always be someone better than you and someone worse than you. On the surface, it seems may not seem like a useful thought exercise. But in truth, the saying suggests that comparison is often very useless and arbitrary. Comparisons are often only based on our subjective experience because there's no objective measure that is truly sufficient to account for the variability in life. It doesn't account for the fact that you had a bad day or less opportunity than someone else, and so it's not a level playing field. It also doesn't mean you're any less useful or awesome than they are; it just means you didn't perform as well at a given task and doesn't preclude you from performing well at others.

> Success is not a zero-sum game.

It took me many years to recognize that success is not a zero-sum game. If someone is doing better than you, that doesn't necessarily mean they are taking away from your success. Even if they get the position you don't get, that doesn't mean you can't be successful. It's not *personal*, it's not about you being less than them, it's their success and it's distinct from you. Conflating someone else's success with your lack of success is a dangerous path to walk, and leads to unhappiness and resentment.

###2) **Listen to your self-doubt, then correct it**

We tell ourselves quiet words of self-doubt and self-deprecation consistently throughout the day. It can lead us to feel like [imposters](http://dontshootthealbatross.com/writing/impostor-syndrome), and feel like we can't be as successful or as liked as others because we don't belong.

The first step to righting your self-worth is to notice when you tell yourself you are incapable. Note that you aren't flawed or incapable, you just tell yourself you are every day. Question why you are saying this and recognize that your messages are based on fear and insecurity. Question this fear; ask yourself what am I afraid of? Why am I afraid?

If you find yourself saying you aren't good, investigate the feeling and reevaluate it. Does so-and-so really think I'm an idiot, or is she just having a bad day? If you apply this practice, you'll start to see the assumptions you make about yourself and others' opinions of you.

> Too many of us fight ourselves every day. Imagine what you could do if you could just get out of your own way.

###3) **Find the center of your self-esteem**

Too many of us fight ourselves every day. Imagine what you could do if you could just get out of your own way. The best gift you can give yourself is to root out the cause of your hurting self-esteem. We can all look at ourselves and point out our flaws, but we aren't so good at figuring out why we think they are flaws. If you can begin to answer the question, "why is it not okay to be imperfect?" then you are on track toward feeling contentment and confidence.

Breaking down the drive for perfection is tricky, and this post certainly won't replace the self-inspection it takes to dig into the motivations that move you toward perfectionism, and ultimately toward self-loathing and self-limitation, but I hope it's a good place to start.
