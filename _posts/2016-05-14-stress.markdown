Stress is ubiquitous and preventing it seems impossible, for me especially. I work in Silicon Valley at one of the biggest tech companies in the world, in an environment where I'm constantly ignorant about systems and processes, and in a town where I don't have many friends and am far away from family. On top of that, I live alone most days of the week as the primary parent to a rowdy puppy. Stress affects me, mentally and physically and curbing it is challenging.

We all have  our unique stressors, but it's not always clear how to improve our mental health without changing our situation -- we think, "it will be better once X is over" or "if only I had more money, I'd be less stressed." Changing our situation can help, but what can you do if you can't control your circumstances?

When my ophthalmologist told me to reduce my stress to alleviate the inflammation in my eye, I knew that I had to prioritize my health. I wasn't in a position to change my job or where I live, so I began looking at things I could control. I worked to change my space, time management, and attitude about my situations.

## 1. Remove Clutter
I have to admit where I live is exceptionally nice. I have a small, but cute, one bedroom apartment across from a park in a beautiful, temperate town. Nevertheless, I have been consistently stressed out and unhappy with my apartment, which seems nonsensical, yet my situation is far from perfect.

For starters, I live in one of the most expensive areas in the entire USA. My rent, for a 550 sq. ft. one-bedroom (with no in-unit laundry) is close to $2000 per month, and that's considered cheap, but is still unreasonable by most people's standards. I chose this location because it's ~20 miles from work, which means it's a lot cheaper since prices go up as you get closer to the big tech companies. That means I trade money and location for a longer commute time. 

The size was also a problem for me -- 550 sq. ft. is not a lot of space for all the stuff I had moving in. I felt like I was constantly unhappy with the look of the place, how it felt, and what I was getting for the money. I was constantly on Craigslist and Zillow, hoping to find a magical gem which was actually worth the cost, and ogled homes on Pinterest, imagining a place that would be just the right style for me.

### Realize You Already Have Enough
At first, I decided to deal with the stress by adding things that I thought would make my space feel better. But the problem was, I already had too much stuff to fill the apartment, and the overcrowding was stressing me out more. It was also stressing out my husband, who had always been a religiously tidy person. We used to argue about cleaning up constantly, and I always felt like the lazy one.

After reading **The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up** by Marie Kondo, I decided that I should make an effort to tidy up the place, if only out of compassion for my husband. I also knew that decluttering would perhaps help me love my space more. The KonMarie method helped me start to separate my stuff from my emotions -- I was finally able to appreciate the value of asking, "Why on earth am I holding onto this?" and I was able to let go a lot of things that weren't adding value to my life.

With the excess cleared away, I felt a great sense of relief -- the space felt *good*. It was more open and I finally had space to breathe -- it was also extremely easy to keep clean. At first, I did add a few things to the space, but over time, I didn't want to [add to the space](http://dontshootthealbatross.com/minimalism/similicity-sophistication) and realized that there was almost no value for me in bringing more into the home when it was perfect just as it is.

## 2. Make Time and Make it Enjoyable
With the home squared away, I turned my attention to how I was spending my time. Time is not a renewable resource. Unlike money, it can't be gained or lost, only spent and the time you spend doing activities that aren't fulfilling or that pile on stress can diminish the quality of your relaxation time. I found this to be true with my commute, which was accounting for an hour and a half to two hours of my day. After spending all day at work and driving the hour home, I was often so overwhelmed and stressed that I would give in and just [veg out with Netflix](http://dontshootthealbatross.com/minimalism/hobbies/lifestlye/netflix-sabbatical). This was less fun for [Watson](https://www.instagram.com/elementary_cardi/), who didn't get as much play time as he deserved during the week.

### Do Less and Get More Out of It
The first step toward feeling like I had control of my time was to do less. With my new appreciation for my apartment, I spent less time thinking about how to make it better, what to buy, and how to achieve the **perfect** space. I canceled my Netflix subscription and metered myself by buying TV shows, one $3.99 episode at a time. The price of vegging out became too much and I eventually gave it up. At first, I was bored since I had spent all my time watching Netflix and didn't know what to do. However, when I started working on my revitalized hobbies, I cured my boredom fairly quickly and found that my time was much
more fulfilling.

Making time for hobbies at home also meant I had something to look forward to after the work day. I had more time in the evenings to do what I thought would enhance me, rather than waste my time. As a bonus,  I also spend a lot more active time with Watson, who is always happy to chase a ball when I get home.

### Reclaim your  Wasted Commute Time
With the commute, it took time, but I found ways to reduce my commute time and make it more enjoyable. I find that a healthy mix of audiobooks, podcasts, and an Internet music subscription kept my commutes fresh, even in traffic. I also learned to let go of my road rage, accepting that people are bad drivers and it's not personal. Since I have a flexible work schedule, on days when I leave Watson at home, I'll work from home in the morning and leave later when traffic is lighter that way he isn't home alone for more than 8 or 9 hours. Whenever possible, I take a shuttle to work and try and read on the bus. This gives me more "me" time and allows me 30-45 minutes per day where I have nothing else I need to be doing. 

Even if you can't fix your commute, you can still reduce your stress about it by following these suggestions for [making your commute enjoyable](http://www.autoinsurancecenter.com/6-ways-to-reduce-commuter-stress.htm).

### Give 100% of your Attention
My husband and I have been in a long distance relationship for half of the time we've been together now, which is 4 out of 8 years. We live about 3 hours apart and see each other every possible weekend. However, even when we were together, it seemed like I was still 3 hours away. I often distracted myself with my phone when we would spend time together, browsing Pinterest, Facebook or Craigslist while watching shows together. I could tell it was really irritating my husband -- we were not always on the same page because we just weren't together enough. It only made my loneliness worse by being absent from our time together, and I knew it had to change.

I realized that the best thing I could do was to give my husband my full attention. There is no compromise -- relationships only last when you make an effort to be together with your full attention, so you can be in-tune with your partner and catch the nuances of his/her life. Being long-distance exacerbates everything, so spending time together, **real** time, is the only sustainable way to have a relationship.

## 3. Reducing your Reaction to Stress
No matter how much we try and reduce stress, there will be moments when you just can't control what stresses you out. I knew I also needed to deal with how I was handling stress because it was a part of the larger stress problem. Rather than **reacting** to stress, I learned you can **respond** to stress with clear intention. I first learned about this by exploring Mindfulness Meditation, a practice that involves learning to focus your mind on your breath and then refocus it when your mind inevitably wanders. What happens is you start to become aware of how you mind latches onto feelings and ideas and you begin to separate the immediate reaction to follow your mind down the rabbit hole and you simply observe it. I highly recommend Dan Harris' book [*10% Happier*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18505796-10-happier?from_new_nav=true&ac=1&from_search=true), which discusses his journey through discovering meditation after having a panic attack on live television.

The cool thing about Mindfulness Meditation is that it actually works. There have been numerous studies which show that it helps to reduce anxiety and depression and may help with things like immune function (which I could use more of), although more research into its immunological benefits needs to be done.

I've been trying meditation within the past few months and I've found that I'm less reactive to my own anxiety and stress. Even in moments of intense anxiety, I feel I can escape the negative spirals more quickly. It might be a complete coincidence, but I've also been free of inflammation in my eye for 2 months (which is the longest I've been iritis-free since it started last year). 

## How has it helped?
I certainly haven't reduced all stress, but I feel I've made a positive step in learning to recognize the stressors I can control and in identifying areas I can change, even if my larger circumstances don't change. Most of all, I learned that reducing stress requires you to identify the stressors and learn to edit them out or respond to them differently. In the past few months, I've been happier and more satisfied with my circumstances because I don't feel like I'm a victim of them. It's a step up from where I was a few months ago and I feel better as a result. Taking action has helped me and I hope that the process of analyzing my stressors helps you better apply the same approach to your stress.
