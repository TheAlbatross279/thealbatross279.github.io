In the process of exploring the idea of a Tiny House last year, I came across the idea of Zero Waste, or the goal of producing as little trash as possible by buying in bulk, recycling, refusing plastic and other items, and generally making your own instead of buying packaging. I first heard about it on one of my deep YouTube dives, where I found Lauren Singer's Channel and blog [*Trash is for Tossers*](http://www.trashisfortossers.com/) and then stumbled upon the source, Bea Johnson's [*Zero Waste Home*](http://www.zerowastehome.com/).

There are a few things that really appeal to me about this concept: for one, it relieves the sense of guilt I have throwing stuff away and in the process actually simplifies the meals I make and the food I buy, meaning I will eat healthier overall. What an awesome concept to not have to throw anything away! For Christmas, I received Bea Johnson's book and began reading.

However, this was not going to be easy. For starters, there is no way to do this all of a sudden. You have to really assess what you have in your pantry and try to get through the packaged food because it's ultimately not about only buying in bulk, but not wasting what you've bought. Then there's the issue of jars. Bea uses French canning jars to store everything because Glass is recyclable and doesn't leach like plastic and it also looks wonderful. But what about all of the tupperware we have? Should we donate it? What do we do? What seems like a simple idea has a high upstart cost, both in thinking and in practice.

It was clear that the first step is assessing what you've got and what lifestyle changes you need to make. For example, my husband and I love all sorts of craft beers and cider. This is something we don't really want to give up, so even though we'd have to recycle it over reusing it, it's a sacrifice we're willing to make. We decided to start with the kitchen and work from there. We decided to buy in bulk and try to use up what we had by sending some of our pantry foods with my husband off at school so he could get through them.

I decided to copy Bea and get some of the canning jars that she has. They are excellent quality and definitely worth the investment. My husband and I went out and got a bunch from the Container Store near our house. This meant they came with little SKU stickers, but in terms of waste, this was much better than shipping them because they didn't have to be packed in plastic.

Here is our haul:

We have also been saving some pickle jars and other jars for reuse. While we were getting the canning jars, we also got containers for bulk olive oil and basalmic from Sur La Table (seen in front) and an assortment of mason-type jars for other things.

Knowing I'd have to buy items from the bulk section of Whole Foods, I purchased some reusable bags from Amazon that work for produce and other things:

The solid cloth ones are for nuts, grains, etc. and the mesh ones are for produce.

I had acquired some of these before my husband was home on the weekend (while being away at school), and decided to take my own adventure to Whole Foods down the road. It was harrowing to say the least.

#Adventure 1: The Awkwardness of being "*That* Lady"
I was eager but also nervous when going to Whole Foods by myself, armed with my cloth bags. I had left the jars at home because I decided I wasn't confident enough to ask the meat counter people to put it in the jar for me.

Upon entering, I immediately went for the fruit hoping for some delicious berries. After realizing that my favorite fruit raspberries only came in a plastic clamshell box, I disappointedly got some apples. Hopefully, during the summer, our farmer's market would carry these in baskets. I loaded up on the bulk veggies I could find in the bulk veggie bins.

The dry bulk section went fine in terms of bags. I got what I needed, some dried cranberries for salad, snapping a picture of the PLU for the cashier to use. I didn't need too much, but it was a good start. But when it came time for checking out, I explained that I had written the tare weight of the bags on the tag of the bag, the cashier had no clue what to do. I had written the weight in oz. while the scales took lbs. I was totally embarrassed as the woman called over her manager to help her. They were polite and actually undercharged me by guessing the weight, but I was mortified as the people behind me waited impatiently. 

#Adventure 2: Chris to the rescue
For our second adventure, Chris was eager to go and try out Zero Waste shopping and I was eager to have a confidence boost having him with me. We started with the veggies and fruits, where he also disappointedly found out that raspberries only come in plastic, and decided to forgo the berries in favor of unwrapped apricots. We got some veggies no problem and headed to the bulk bins. This time we got things like granola, nuts, quinoa, couscous, and chickpeas. We also stopped by the olive bar and got olives and got tempted by the cheese.

Bea usually has the people at the Cheese counter cut her selection up and put it in the jar for her. Chris and I were a bit awkward as we tried some of the cheese, and we hadn't brought a jar that would fit it, so we just bought the packaged plastic cheese (baby steps!). 

Next came the meat counter -- I was terrified of confrontation, but this was unbelievably easy. I just asked the nice man behind the counter to put it in the jar for me and to just put the sticker on the jar. He had not problem with it and handed me back my chicken in a jar like it wasn't weird. Same story with the fish counter, it was super easy!

At the checkout, we didn't bother asking the cashier to tare the bags, so we probably got a little over-charged, but to avoid confrontation, I was okay with it. He did tare the jar of nuts and the jar of olives however. 

Overall, it was a success, and when we put everything in the pantry, it became much more beautiful.

Maybe we've got the hang of this after all.
