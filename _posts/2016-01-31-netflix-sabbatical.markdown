The question, "What are you hobbies?" sounds fairly benign but to many, it is a fundamentally terrifying query -- especially to someone who has recently graduated from college. Hobbies? Free time? What have I been doing for the last seven years that I'd consider a hobby? I need time to think about this.

Let's decide some criteria here: first, a hobby is something you have to set aside time for more than one a month, potentially every week or multiple times per week or even every day. Second, hobbies need to be something that you are willing to forgo other things for in favor of spending more time on your hobby. Often hobbies are skill-related, as in the more time you spend, there is a guaranteed minimum level of aptitude you will achieve with time and persistence.

Fundamentally, we can boil this definition down to time spent doing some activity that you would choose to do over something else.

So what had I spent my time on? I wanted to say music, having picked up two instruments in college, the bass guitar and mandolin, or writing, which I hadn't done in any seriousness since I quit my job as a copywriter, but there really was only one dismal answer to that question: Netflix.

I know, right?

In grad school, I found great escapism in watching shows when I should either have been sleeping or working on projects. It was a way to disengage and relax while enjoying a story while coping with the constant stress of school -- and I had an active social life, so it wasn't like I was doing this all the time. However, when I graduated and started working full time and my husband had gone back to school three hours away, I found that coming home, turning on the TV and casting Netflix quickly became my weekday evening ritual. 

It wasn't totally brainless about it either -- I was aware that I was spending all my time watching TV and at some point I determined that my Netflix habits were suddenly meeting the criteria of a hobby. I started answering the question, "what are you hobbies?" with a defeated answer of "watching tv shows."

As someone with two college degrees, this was unsettling and mildly shameful. Instead of carving out time for things that challenged me, I defaulted to the easy route of letting that "next episode starts in 20 seconds" feature take the wheel.

While there is nothing wrong with enjoying shows (I still do), it's definitely not a good idea to spend all of your free time alone, watching TV. But after a year or more of doing this (mostly when Chris was not around during the week), I realized that there were a few things I could no longer classify as hobbies. Most heart-breaking of all was the thought that I was no longer writing or reading, so I really couldn't claim to have these as hobbies anymore.

But if I was unhappy, why was I doing this to myself? I realized that watching Netflix was infinitely easier than writing or reading, and so it was always the preferred choice after a long day at work. I had no ability to moderate my watching either, but the prospect of letting go of other things to support my Netflix habit was so disappointing, I decided to do something I never thought I would do: cancel my Netflix subscription. At least for a while until I learned some self-control.

I'm about 3 months into my Netflix sabbatical, and there have been many many times I miss the seemingly unlimited streaming content of Netflix and HBO Now. But there have also been many improvements: I've already read 3 books and am partway through another 3, which is a huge improvement. I've restarted this blog and made several posts, plus written most of a short story since then. I've cleaned and declut
tered most of my apartment, made more time for Watson and Chris.

So will I go back? Probably not for a long while, simply because I can't meter myself sufficiently to keep the unlimited time sink of Netflix around. I can still watch shows by purchasing them through Google Play Movies, Amazon, etc. or better yet, watching them with friends and family who have accounts. I find if I make it challenging to watch these shows, I will only watch the ones I really want to watch, and default to doing something easier, like cleaning up or reading.

Unfortunately, it's not all sunshine and tulips -- I am really really bored some nights and I end up not doing any of the things I *want* to spend time on. Every once in a while, I do want to disengage and watch a show, but at least it's limited now, and honestly, I have a hard time bingeing anymore because I want to do other things. On nights where I don't feel like doing anything, I usually end up doing something mindless like cleaning up, doing the dishes, cooking, etc. while letting my brain wander and recharge. Bored time is okay too, if you allow your mind to disengage and relax or you can practice mindfulness and train your brain to focus in it's off time. 

If you feel like you want to do something else besides passively consume Netflix or surf the web and social media in your free time, ask yourself, "What do I want to be doing instead?" and really be honest with yourself. Are you willing to give up time to do what you want, or do you not want it enough to do something about it? If you aren't sure, try removing pacifiers from your life once a week and see what you come up with. You might be surprised how much you don't need them and how much free time you really have.
