2015 was a big year for me. It began with a fever, chills, and a impending sense of doom as my body reeled from a sickeness, then sinus infection and conjuntivitus. When the conjuntivitus and the sinus infection cleared, my opthamologist discovered that I also had [itiris](), a condtion where the iris (typically in one eye) becomes inflammed. The condition is usuall idyopathic and occurs only once in most patients -- I am not most patients. A course of topical steroids soon had the inflamtion subsiding, but not without starting my year off with 3 straight weeks of dibilitating sickness.

In the midst of this, I was looking for a puppy. My fiance, now husband, Chris, and I had been looking for some months and had already had to back out of getting a certain puppy because we were dealing with an irreputable breeder. I had been talking to a breeder who lived up in Washington for over a month and was eagerly watching his puppies grow through Facebook. We chose to go the puppy route for a couple reasons the most important being that we could easily mold the puppy to our lifestyle. We decided to go the breeder route because we really wanted a corgi puppy, and as it turns out, rescuing a corgi is not always a good move. Corgis who end up in rescues either have been breed with a bad termperament (usually by a back-yard  breeder) or are too dominant and intelligent that they take advantage of their unsuspecting owners who thought they were just getting a cute dog. We had wanted a corgi because we wanted a portably sized dog that would allow us to meet the size requirements most landlords placed on renters in the Bay area. They are also freaking adorable. Through this process, we learned a lot about corigs and what to look for in terms of temperament and health. So we had found this breeder up north who had several adorable pups ready to go to good homes... at least until he decided that he would keep both male puppies because they would make good show dogs. Fortunately, shortly after finding this out, we talked to a good friend who rescues corgis and had just found a puppy for herself and it turned out that this puppy had a brother. 

His name was Howard and he was a brindle and white Cardigan Welsh Corgi. So in February of 2015, we had Howard shipped out to us from Minnesota. Normally, I would be totally opposed to shipping a puppy, but the price of a two-way ticket was bordering $1000 and the breeder assured me it would be okay. So February 10th, 2015, I went to pick up Howard (dubbed no-name in the meantime because we hated the name Howard) at SFO.

At the time, my husband was in school getting his Master's degree in Computer Science, following my footsteps, on the Central Coast of California. So he was living 3 hours away from me and we only saw each other on the weekends. So I brought home no-name as a first time fur-parent with a 14 week old puppy who was barely house-trained into my small 550 sf apartment. It became very clear that his name should be Watson, and so it was.

To make a long story short, Watson was a sweet and mellow dog, but was very insecure coming from a house full of dogs into an apartment with just me. He was very shy and barked a lot (which he didn't do at the breeder's house) so we were immediately nevous about our neighbors getting angry at us. On top of that, part of the reason we wanted to get a puppy was to train him to come into the office with me. I work at a pet-friendly company and I wanted to have a dog around me at work. Getting a puppy also meant that I would have to bring the puppy with me to work because my long commute meant I was unable to get home to let him out as often as he needed. All-in-all, we were screwed. 

So over the next few months, we worked and trained Watson and realized at some point that his shyness was made worse by being around new humans too much. So we brought it back a bit and kept him home more once he got older. At the same time, I began to have reoccurence after reoccurence of iritis, all while dealing with the separation of myself and my fiance as our wedding loomed in September. 

Our wedding was perfect in my opinion, and it was everything we hoped for. We had asked our friends and family to get us stuff for camping as wedding gifts, so when the wedding was done, we embarked on a week-long camping trip to Big Sur where we took Watson and tried out our newfound gear. In the peaceful moments of the serene nature-filled campsite we stayed at, I began reading a book called The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying up by Marie Kondo and I decided that as part of my goal to reduce stress, I decided that decluttering my small apartment, cleaning and maintaining the space would help reduce my stress and improve my health. And it was this decision that started me on a new journey.

Since that time, I've decluttered a lot of my space and gotten into minimalism and some zero waste efforts. I'm hoping to improve my space and mentality to help keep my iritis and any underlying systemic issues under control.

As part of this effort, I've also tried to get back into the habit of reading and writing. When I was younger, I used to read a lot and spent a lot of time writing stories. I very much wanted to become a writer and went to college to study English. In the process, I found I loved langauge and wanted to study linguistics, and eventually computational linguistics. I went "back" to school and did a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing. In the process of becoming a technologist, I let technology take up my time with gadgets and Netflix, I had no more time for quiet contemplation and the quiet habits of reading and writing. So I declared my apartment a Netflix-free zone for the time being and began this blog in the effort to share my experiences but also give me something to write about.
